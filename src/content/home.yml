testimonials:
  - quote: A beautiful, comfortable well equipped cottage. Loved the logburner! Good
      location for touring from - from as near as Haltwhistle to as far as
      Lindisfarne. Wallace Arms a lovely friendly pub as per your welcome pack.
      We really enjoyed our stay - so relaxing & peaceful. Would definitely
      recommend you
  - quote: A warm and cozy welcome on arrival in stormy weather. The tranquility and
      setting is food for the soul, with wonderful walks from the door (followed
      by a nap in front of the log burner!). The Northumbrian landscape is
      varied and breath taking, with Hadrian's Wall a must see. The autumn
      colours have added extra inspiration and we are leaving with the knowledge
      there is so much more to enjoy in this area.
  - quote: We have had a fantastic time. Beautiful walks and so peaceful. The
      cottage is lovely and cosy definitely will come again. There is so much to
      see and do all in a short drive from the cottage.
